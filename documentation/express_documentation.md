# Express documentation

## Setup

To get an **Express** app working, we need Node.js and npm package manager.

To check the version of Node and npm on your machine use

- `node -v`
- `npm -v`

Install Express.js with the command

- `npm install express`

First create simple Express app following the Hello World tutorial [here](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html).

Run the app with the command

- `node index.js`

### Nodemon

Recommended to use Nodemon so the server restarts automatically on every save.
